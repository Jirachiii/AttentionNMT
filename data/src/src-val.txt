What's Tom doing tomorrow?
Can I speak to the doctor?
Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?
Do you really want to help?

Tom put some rice in a bowl.
What're you doing with those?
Why didn't you think of that before?

If it is raining, I won't go out tonight.
That's my problem, not yours.

Your shirt is inside out.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Look at the girls.
It seems weird to me.
Can't we talk about this later?

Isn't that your dictionary?
It looks like you're in a good mood.
Tom seems to be aware of my feelings.

This is difficult.
School bores me.

You should make better use of your free time.
She's an individualist.
We need to do that now.
Did you study French yesterday?
She gave me a watch.
Were you at the party?
I'm not brave.

What else did you do there?
You should try to learn a little French.
I prefer oranges to apples.

I wouldn't have done that if I'd known it would make Tom angry.
I promise you'll be happy.
Where exactly did you see Tom?
I begged her not to go there.
The boy is wearing glasses.
Tom is looking pretty good.
I'd describe him as a middle-aged man in a yellow jacket, orange tie and a pink shirt.
It's better to walk back than to get lost.
This is very simple.
Do you hear something?
Tom has no enemies.
Let's do it this way.

Why do you want to take a taxi?
Do you want me to call Tom?

Think before you speak.
He went blind.
Everybody was gathered in the living room.
He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
How are you going to Boston?

Can you keep a secret?
I'm from Tokyo, Japan.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Yawning is contagious.

You should call the police.
Tom painted the wall pink.
It's important that you stay in bed.
Tom spent the afternoon with Mary.
What do you have on for tomorrow night?
You took some unnecessary risks.
We watch television every evening.
"Tom has been putting on some weight" "Yeah, I noticed that."
I can't believe that Tom just left without saying anything.
Are you really alone?
I should've kept my mouth shut.
Tom wants to do that now.
We met in Australia.
Japan is a strange country.
She's six years older than I am.
We should eat more vegetables.
Don't go in my room.
Tom began to kiss Mary.
Tom gets offended easily.
You should have taken all that into consideration.
I'm not a marathon runner.
Both were intoxicated.
I pulled over on the side of the road and got out.
I've answered your questions.
Which do you like better, apples or bananas?
This year is going to be prosperous.
Tom carried Mary into the house.
No one knows the answer.
I can't help anyone.

I have nothing to write on.
A guy named Tom was looking for you this morning.
She greeted us with a smile.
I called you because I need to ask you a question.
What time's your curfew?

Saying hurtful things about others is wrong.
I'm starting to fall in love with you.
I thought that you were my best friend.
I can bake bread.
Is this your tea?
I didn't ask Tom.
I'm going for help.
I shouldn't have trusted you.
I have no problem with that.
Even though it's raining, it's not raining hard enough to need an umbrella.
Tom suggested that what Mary did was intentional.
Things like that happen.
It's about time we had some warm weather.

I was really surprised.
Do you have any children you haven't told me about?
I didn't buy everything Tom asked me to buy.
Don't look for us.

I'd like to be woken up tomorrow at 6:30.
He is in good physical condition.
I don't know what you're looking for.

Why did you leave?
I enjoy it more each time.
We have less than three hours.
They smiled at one another.
I'm a bit groggy.
Tom doesn't know where Mary learned how to drive.
Didn't you see me?
Tom wrote his name on the cover of his notebook.

Would you please not smoke here?
Get out of bed!
We have a wide choice of books.
I don't have any feelings for Tom at all.
The tree grew very tall.
Some complications have arisen.

Please tell the others everything you've just told me.
Get me something to eat.
My job is boring.

She's wearing a nice hat.
I have to try a little harder next time.
I thought about my family.
You look bad.
I've got something else to tell you.
Tom wanted to stay.
The problem remains unsolved.
I think married people have more problems than single people.
My brother is very tall.
Tom is your father.
I got up at about six.
I was busy yesterday.
It isn't how it seems.
I have a tourist visa.
You're charming.
Are you my doctor?
Are we safe here?
I advise you not to do that.
Tom denied everything.
I've already done this several times.
What is that greasy stuff on your shirt?
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
I need it now.
I'm allergic to dust.
I told you Tom would give me something for my birthday.
It's really hot today.
Each passing car threw up a cloud of dust.
Tom wasn't asleep.
Tom is doing that very well.
Unfortunately, there is no simple answer.
We hope you enjoy the result.
When are you coming back home?

It's going to be all right.
It doesn't matter anyway.
What do you mean by it?
I was there the other day.
I don't let Tom drive.
Tell Tom to give you some scissors.
I will promise you nothing.
Where's the Australian embassy?
I deleted the file by accident.

You're better than you think.
Don't forget to call your mom.
I went to the lawyer for legal help.
Tom didn't sing the song that we requested.
My heart was racing.
We expect Tom to come back soon.
You're asking the wrong person.
He has more money than he can use.
Tell Tom why you didn't do that.
Recently, there are a lot of burglaries around here.

"Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?" "Ask away."
Try not to get lost again.
I went home early.
Is it okay if I borrow these books?
Are you eating lunch?
Tom wasn't a carpenter.
Keep going. Don't give up. You can do it.
He gets mad very easily.
Come and eat some chocolate cake.
Tom looked like a rich man.
You're lucky that you have a job.
Jump as high as you can.
The candle flickered a few times and then went out.

The embers are still glowing.
My eyes feel itchy.
I don't cry very often.
She showed me around the campus.
I was falsely accused.
You're really nice.
I was singing.
Tom doesn't like us either.
Did you collect the money they owed you?
Who attended the meeting?
I want to get a divorce.
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
Are you going by bus or car?
That kind of thing can't be found just anywhere.
Tom had some questions he wanted to ask.
I really do miss my parents a lot.
What do you and Tom want to do?
Tom may have been there.

We all make mistakes.
You almost sound disappointed.
Please don't feed the wild animals.

He has knowledge and experience as well.
Why don't you get on with your job?
Tom walked Mary to the subway station.
Mary wrote her number on a piece of paper and handed it to Tom.
Do you mind if I close the door?
A penny for your thoughts.
Do you understand what you have to do?
Tom said that he thought that Mary's suggestion was good.
I know it was you.
I'm studying computer science.
I'll try to keep up with you.
This wasn't an easy decision for us.
The reason is very simple.
Visitors and guests are welcome.
I didn't read the book.
Please speak more loudly so everybody can hear you.
Are all these books yours?

Isn't this against the rules?
This is my handbag.
I still have some work to do.
Tom left his briefcase on his desk.
Tom was the first one to leave.
Would you please look after the children?
You need a key.
That made me very sad.
They could do with our help.
I find rain and wind more relaxing than the chirping of birds.
Don't you have to be over twenty-one to do that?
They'll find you.
Where will the flea market be?
The question doesn't concern me.
Tom regretted laughing.
It's not likely that Tom did that on purpose.

What's the matter with you? Are you nuts?
Tom started reading.
It's your only chance.
Tom couldn't keep his mind off Mary.
Everyone's in position.
Do you have relatives abroad?
I saw my friend running up the stairs.
I'm so glad you're home.
Mary took a little mirror out of her purse and checked her hair and make-up.
He intended to marry her.
You think that I'm wasting my time with him.

Tom wasn't there all day.
You can go if you want to.
Tom was born the same day as his cat.

Tom wants much more.
I'm sorry you had to wait.
It can't be measured in terms of money.
Tom hesitated for a while.
I reckon it's quite good.
Tom helped Mary move the sofa to other side of the room.
That's the way it works.
We have business to discuss.
Tom grimaced slightly.
That clock isn't quite right.
I knew that something terrible was about to happen.
He had many political enemies.
Tom is going to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tell Tom to stop following me around.
What are you going to do?
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
What's Tom given us?
I don't mind being criticized when I am wrong.
I think you're right.
You're tough.
I took the liberty of calling her.
It looks like you need to cook this a bit longer.
Tom and Mary don't have any savings.
What did you eat when you were in Australia?
Sorry about that.

It's so warm in this room that I'm sweating.
Tom was interrupted by a knock at the door.

Watch me now.
Can't you do it?
Horses and donkeys are different.
Do you want me to help you?
Tom has a house with a pool.
I'm taking care of my grandfather.
It goes without saying that health is important.
I'll look around the city today.
We didn't have to come.
That was serious.
She talked as if she were my mother.
It was quite dark when I got home.
I'm tired of people telling me what to do.
I thought I told you to stay away from my computer.

Have you ever lived anywhere else?
You must be tired after such a long trip.

Does that mean anything to you?
That's absolutely disgusting.
Everything is over.
Does anyone in your close family have heart disease?
They have no right to be here.

He was surprised at the long-distance phone bill.
Will you help me translate this?
I'm going home now.
Frankly speaking, his new novel is not very interesting.
How did you know about that?

I'm happy, very happy.
The calendar is hanging on the wall.
I have important business to take care of in my office.

Money doesn't mean anything to me.
Provide water to the thirsty and food to the hungry.
Tom refused to stop eating meat.
Can you guess the worth of the diamond?
I'm a monk.
Tom removed his disguise.
When eating, don't speak with food in your mouth.
I am accustomed to working hard.
Aren't you getting hungry?
He appeared hungry.
Tom pushed Mary into the room and closed the door.
He told a very funny joke.
