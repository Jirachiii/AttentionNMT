Look closer.
What were you doing at Tom's house?
I'll always remember your kindness.

I'd like to know why you were late.
I'm catching the 11:00 train.
Tom has put on some weight.
You'd better hurry up if you want to get home before dark.
I wish that I could turn back time.
They live in a house.
The country needs your help.
I have to be here.
I'm going to Tom's house.
You will save yourself a lot of time if you take the car.
I was born on June 4, 1974.

We don't talk much.
Does the room have air conditioning?

I nearly left my umbrella on the train.
I told some jokes.
Though I've decided to go to the party, I'm not looking forward to it.
Just take my word for it.
Does Tom play basketball?
She's very innocent.
I should think so.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
Reading develops the mind.
She has no self-esteem.
It's an honor to meet you.
I forgot her name.
Tom didn't even try to pretend that he liked Mary.
I saw a strange woman there.
Here's your tea.
I'll make a note of that.
What's it doing out here?
That bag is mine.
Tom spread the towel out on the ground.
You're welcome.
He sang a song.
All we can do is to wait for him.
Let's go!
Put out your cigarette. Smoking's not permitted here.
Almost all the workers objected to working at night.
Has Tom already returned?
Tell everybody.
How long do we stop here?
You'll have to be more specific.
Tom arrived in the nick of time.
Is Tom the one who took you there?
How did you guys first meet each other?
Tom can't afford to send his children to college.
I've read both books.
Mary is my mother-in-law.
The story was so complicated that I couldn't follow it.
We're ready to leave.
I think Tom is a little too optimistic.
Can I take a break now?
We went from Boston to Chicago by car.
Have you ever been to the Black Sea?
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Congress passed the bill.
Was Tom speaking French or English?
According to Tom, Mary got married last month.
Tom should've left when he had the chance.
I was suddenly unsure whether I'd locked my car.
What's your favorite food?
I have to make enough money to support my family.
Is that your car in the driveway?
Tom was so cold his teeth were chattering.
That was very funny.
Tom hasn't been here for years.
I went to the store to buy what I needed to make dinner.
We're having lunch.
Every time I see you, I think of your mother.
Tom sounded genuinely concerned.
Tom is an actor.
We're stuck.
I think he is a good man.
Please give me a drink.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I've never seen Tom so happy.
The train was so packed that I had to stand up during the whole trip.
I've lived here for about thirteen years.
Traveling by boat takes longer than going by car.
We're about the same size.
Tom didn't live to see the end of the war.
I'll miss you very much if you go.
Tom and Mary are really proud of their children.
I know you're thinking about me.
Tom doesn't really want to go with us.
Pardon me, do you speak English?
I got the job I applied for.
Don't worry about it.
Mary came home from school in tears because her friends had teased her.
I like to go to the movies.
Do that for me.
I'd like to be friends with Tom.
Tom and Mary couldn't help looking at each other.
Will you be staying long?
I could have bought that for you.
Don't say it in a roundabout way.
Physics is a branch of science.
Is it safe to eat this?
A man came to see him.
Tom didn't convince me.
I don't enjoy fishing as much as I used to.
Do we have any French homework that needs to be turned in tomorrow?
Tom and Mary are planning to vote for the same candidate.
I thought you said you didn't speak French.
Tom knew he barely had enough time to do everything that had to be done.
The sky has brightened.
He left the house without so much as saying goodbye.
He is not what he was.
God made the universe.
Tom didn't know Mary could swim.
You can't blame them for being curious.
I like to drink wine.
After his accident, he is happy to be alive.
You are off the point.
May I bring a friend?
I'll be there in about 30 minutes.
Why exactly would you want to do that?
We'd like you to come with us.
What makes you happy?
We talked quietly so we wouldn't wake the baby.
It's working.
Tom offered his help to us.
You really should be helping Tom.
One must do one's best in everything.
Not all of those men are doctors.
You know I didn't mean it.
Tom has already explained that to us.
Is there a dress code?
How are we supposed to do that?
I haven't quite decided.
I'd like to have a single room with a bath for two nights.
Many English words are derived from Latin.
Tom said you wouldn't come.
I spent the day at Tom's house.
This rarely happens.
I'm sorry that you can't come this evening.
She complained of a headache.
Were you promoted?
Some children are playing on the grass.
What's the relationship between politics and war?
A bad cold has kept me from studying this week.
Tom can't be too far behind us.
Do as you think fit.
Can you describe the object?
Tom can't read yet.
This machine should help save time.
I've had a headache for three days and I can't get rid of it.
I think they're capable of doing that.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I don't know where this came from.
Tom shouldn't have been there.
We're not welcome.
Wait.
I didn't want to spend my whole life there.
Do you smoke cigars?
I know your brother very well.
Her son is a genius.
I'm feeling much better now.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing?
Were you unlucky?
She blushed.
Tom told the waiter that he wanted to sit by the window.
Mary and I dated a long time ago.
Tell me that we haven't failed.
There are plenty of rocks.
I never wanted Tom here in the first place.
Tom came home very late.
Tom has to have an operation on his back.
Tom looked really happy.
How tall is your brother?
When was the last time you spoke with Tom?
That's Tom's girl.
The soldiers crossed the river by swimming.
I want to kiss you.
We'll accept anything.
Could you take a photo of me?
His mother sighed with relief.
Tom is a dancer.
Tom is wearing a mask.
Tom looks like he's sorry.
Why is love so difficult?
The children got some presents.
Give these children three pieces each.
Tom is the tallest in our class.
We couldn't open the door because it was locked from the inside.
You're famous now.
Do you have a cellphone?
You must face your fears.
How old is your wife?
Hardly anyone even tries.
We're reading.
Tom's got nothing to lose.
I tried to be careful.
They searched Tom.
I think you went too far.
It's Christmas.
I think a movie is more entertaining than any book.
This is the best-tasting cheese I've ever eaten.
Tom is going to be staying here with us for three months.
I think it's not worth the risk.
Crime does not pay.
Tom might believe us, but I doubt it.
We'll be there at half past two.
Mary has beautiful hair.
I can see what you mean.
You know this.
A nervous person will not be fit for this job.
The town is accessible by rail.
Do you like going to school?
You should win tomorrow.
Are you sure you don't want to do that?
You have a good plan.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
I try.
I was not conscious of his presence.
There hasn't been any rain for the past three months.
I wonder why the bus is late.
Where will you stay when you go to Boston?
Are you satisfied with the political situation in your country?
He hit the bull's-eye.
I can't see you anymore.
They have assigned me a small room.
I'm the copilot.
You've spilt your coffee.
Can you think of any reason why Tom would've done that?
You're my boss.
I don't make friends easily.
What do you find so interesting about squirrels?
Let me see you again.
Will you still love me when I'm old?
Who else is gone today?
Tom could hardly wait to tell his friends.
He's already left.
I know that Tom is exhausted.
Tom likes raw carrots.
Despite repeated warnings, Tom didn't stop doing that.
The egg is a universal symbol of life and rebirth.
He played his trump card.
They forgave you.
Tom isn't the only one who's drunk.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
I want you to stay here until I get back.
A female friend of ours took a trip to a small village last week.
I can't untie this knot.
Tom was sick.
I'm coming to your party.
My brother speaks very quickly.
My sister is famous.
That's very kind of you, Tom.
Tom helped himself to a slice of pizza.
Would you care to accompany me?
I'll be waiting with Tom.
Do you have many friends?
Tom was in front of me in line.
Welcome.
Nobody slept.
What kind of students do you teach?
There is a man waiting for you at the door.
A general is a high-ranking military officer.
I'll call you back later.
I don't want to live alone.
Do you want to have some tea?
I hope you had a good time at the party.
She won an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.
He took her by the hand.
When does Tom get back from his trip?
Who cheated?
Hey, you're not Tom.
Some people are killing time relaxing on park benches.
I'm learning how to drive.
I really couldn't have done this without you.
Her gray hair makes her look older than her age.
What a strange dog!
I knew nothing about that.
I had no idea there'd be this many people here.

I'm not falling for that one again.
Tom is a very rich person.
I wasn't unhappy.
No one's perfect.
It was always like that.
We agree on this point.
It snowed a lot.
I think that she knows the truth.
Only Tom knows.
Your book is on the desk.
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
It is almost three.
This convenience store is open 24/7.
I hope that he will succeed.
Tom often accepted bad advice.
Tom is back again.
He lives across the street.
Beat it.
I need you.
Did you call him up yesterday?
Tom took the train.
Call a doctor.
When did you buy that?
If that happens again, I'll leave.
Will you go to the meeting in my place?
Tom is teaching me to paint.
I'll tell you what it is.
I'd like you to meet my parents.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Tom was born in the winter.
You might want to sit down. This is going to take a while.
Tom offered me a piece of cake.
Does this mean that you don't love me anymore?
First, you must protect yourself.
I just have a couple of questions.
That depends on whether you are interested or not.
I will be at your house at eight.
I like to walk.
Listen to this.
You look really pale. Are you all right?
It was just a passing infatuation.
I built this doghouse by myself.
I wonder why Tom is upset.
Don't cry. Everything will be OK.
They loved it.
Tom put off his departure till Sunday.
They now have three kids.

Say what you think.
Please get the clothes in before it rains.

If anybody had asked me if I were married, I'd have said yes.
Tom is quite old.
Don't just stand there. Come on in.
When did Tom graduate from high school?
Tom got ripped off.
We divided the money equally.
No sooner had I hung up than the phone started ringing again.
Stand still.
The work has already begun.
It's easier than it looks.
I've enjoyed working with you.
Tom spilled red wine all over Mary's white dress.
Tom has enormous potential.
Take your time. There's no rush.
Five plus three is eight.
Tom loved his dog.
Mary is a bit like her mother.
Your shipment should be delivered within 24 hours.
Please telephone him.
Anyway, it all worked out.
They sound disappointed.
You're not from around here, are you?
The meeting will begin in five minutes.
Do you really think Tom might be tempted to do that?
Tom's wondering if any of his kids will remember that today is Father's Day.
That's not something that we've ever talked about.
Tom fell asleep on the couch while watching TV.
Tom was arrested for shoplifting.
He disappeared.
She's eight years old.

Tom wanted to make some new friends.
I have orders.
Where has Tom been?
The town fell into ruin.
Tom quickly wrote down everybody's names.
Make yourself useful.
I couldn't make myself heard in the noisy class.
You're not allowed to park there.
I've got the car keys.
Mary wore a flowered dress.
Tom poked the ant hill with a stick.
You've got no choice.
Nobody in the office can stand working with Tom.
Mary wants to get her belly button pierced.
What's Tom want?
I don't tolerate incompetence.
That's someone else's problem.
Can I work here?
Keep writing.
When was the last time you won a prize?
I wish I had a chance to finish it.
I don't have any plans for next weekend.
They are both very competent judges.
Tom likes hot curry.
The accident occurred at dawn.
All that is beside the point now.
Tom finally smiled.
I have a slight fever today.
We have no choice but to give up the whole plan.
How was your weekend?
Is that the key you're looking for?
The population of Tokyo is greater than that of London.
The leaves have begun to change colors.
I'm sure Tom told you that.

You should not have lent the money to such a person.
He had to call on all his experience to carry out the plan.
I wonder how long we'll have to do that.
You made the same mistake again.
You're the only one who does that, aren't you?
That's a good question to ask.
My brother may have to be operated on for the knee injury.
Where can I get a map?
I love spicy food.
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
Tom and three other crew members were injured in the accident.
You ought to go now.
Now I know why Tom hates me.
You looked angry.

Then he got dressed, stuffed his lecture notes into his briefcase, and ran down the stairs.
Life is often compared to a voyage.
It doesn't have to be like that.
I don't really understand it.
Don't listen to Tom. He's lying to you.

I was very skeptical.
Here is their photo album.
The game was very exciting.
You must've been wrong.
I didn't notice anything either.
It's a unique situation.

He is the taller of the two boys.
The workers took pride in their work.
He did a very foolish thing.

It wasn't as cheap as I thought it'd be.
Everyone was laughing and having a great time.
I'm not questioning your competence.
I'm aware of that.
I couldn't catch the train.
I had to work on an essay.

He has not come yet. Something may have happened to him.
Let's have a party tonight.
We're out of coffee.
Tom wants to borrow money from me again.
Tom sat at his desk.
I work nights.
Don't even get me started.
I am telling a story.
I have a degree in biology.
Frankly speaking, this novel isn't very interesting.
Thanks. You've been a big help.
Easy come, easy go.
Tom could do it.
You simply don't understand.
I'll need your help.
You're the only person I know who can help me.
They can't protect us forever.
She said she would be back right away.
Her idea is better than yours.
Tom made this mistake intentionally.
I don't like to make a mistake.
Tom said you could keep it.
This one is for us.
Tom seemed to be unconscious.
Release Tom.
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
I think you look fine.

Could you speak more slowly?
When did it begin to rain?
Call me when you're ready.
I don't have anything to add.
Tom was called names by his classmates.
We've searched everywhere. There's nowhere else to look.
Tom squatted down.
I'm still not hungry yet.
There was no one in the hall.
Tom's polite.
