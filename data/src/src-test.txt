What's that got to do with it?
For a long moment, the two looked at each other.
That's not where I'm going.
We'll be back after the break.

I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.
Please tell me what to do.

You'll do exactly as I say.
Don't add too much salt.
I have to take medicine.
Tom got nothing.

I thought you might want a drink.
Don't you know what happened yesterday?
What's your favorite radio station?
Would you like to have a look?
Why do you think that's a bad idea?
Tom put his glasses on.
That's for you to decide.
I don't think that Tom has a driver's license.

I wasn't aware of that.
That isn't a reason to panic.
Will you open this jar for me?
Tom is quite likable.
Tom is reserved.
I'm still not used to living in Australia.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
I will speak to him alone.
Whenever my uncle comes, he brings some nice things for us.
Sorry, what's your name?
No one here asked for Tom's opinion.
If you were more ambitious, you could go a long way.

You are expecting too much of her.
Am I disturbing anything?
She is rather poor at tennis.
Come here by ten at the latest.

It's cold, so I want to eat something hot.
I'm awaiting inspiration.
I may be late for dinner.
Just follow them.
I didn't know he had a weak heart.
You promised me.
These shoes belong to me.
